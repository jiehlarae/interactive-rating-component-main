## Overview

### The Challenge

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.
- Select and submit a rating from 1 to 5.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for dynamic behavior

### What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of JavaScript for managing user interactions. Here's a snippet of code that Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

```javascript
for (let btn of btns) {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
        for (let b of btns) {
            b.style.backgroundColor = '';
            b.style.color = '';
        }

        btn.style.backgroundColor = '#fff';
        btn.style.color = '#262E38';
        ratingValue = btn.innerText;
    })
}

submitBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
    startState.style.display = 'none';
    ratingState.style.display = 'block';
    rateScore.innerText = ratingValue;
})
```

This code manages the rating selection and displays the thank you message upon submission. Additionally, I enjoyed using Flexbox to ensure a responsive design that works well across different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Going forward, I plan to explore more about forms and how they function, particularly focusing on form validation and submission handling. I aim to deepen my understanding of how to create robust, user-friendly forms.
